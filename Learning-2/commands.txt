xargs is a command used to make a command accept a command line input


EX - date | echo 
    Blank
    
date | xargs echo

saturday 09 august 2025  07:50:33 PM IST

so the echo command usually dosent accept a command line input but if you use the xargs command it accepts both command line input and command line arguments



------------------  Navgating the file system ------------------------

pwd - pwd (print working directory) is the abberivation of the pwd command pwd is use to which directory you are currently working

ls - ls command is used to list the files in the current directory you are in ls stands for list

in the list command blue text indiacates folders

ls -l puts everything in the long form option

ls -F puts a slash after every folder so it is easier to find

ls -lh - which is a lot more human readable

ls -a is a  command that allows you to see all the folders in the the directory in which you are inc. the hidden files

cd - cd command is a command used for navigating through the file system easily
the cd command helps us to the the directory. cd( change directory )

ex - cd downloads
 the directory from which you are from  to the directory of downloads
 
 ~ - the tilda represents the home directory 
 
 ex 
 
 cd ~ 
 it changes from the current folder you are  to the folder of home
 
 or a even better way to change from the current folder is just to type cd
 it changes back to the home folder automattically
 
 there are two main hidden folder in the hidden folder section which is the . and the .. folders. The dot(.) folder simpy reffers to the current directory. And the double dot (..) folder reffer to the parent folder
 
 
 
 The slash (/) folder refferes to the base folder and the /home folder refferes to  the folder below your own home folder .. the home folder of the computer more than yours
 
 Tab compltetion
  
  tab completetion is a useful extetntetion in the terminal
  purpose - to auto complete text and save time
  
  example - cd /h (click the tab button)
  
  Result - cd /home/
  
  if the option had far more options than 1 option we can press the tab button twice to see the options
  
  ex - /home/ram/D (tab)
  result - /home/ram/D
  
  ex (1) - /home/ram/doc (tab)
  result - /home/ram/documents 
  
  
  
  so we use the tab button twice to activate the checking option
  
  trick -
   
   so we go the the folder part and right click  in the mouse so that we get a option named open terminal so it directly opens directly in the terminal
   
   File extentiton
   
   the file command - the file command is a command to uncover which type of file that you are dealing with like txt doc etc
   
   so if you name a file tux.png and just use the file command on it like this (file tux.png) it will tell that it is a png file but even if you change the extention to jpg it will still show png so that is point no.1
   
   so if you have a file named bla.ods it opens up smoothly but even if you change the extentition in bla.shablam it still opens up with the date and smoothly because
   if it was you own made extentition it dosent recognise it so it seeks help form the linux to determine the file extetntetion by itself
   
   
   
   
                                               _---____---wild-cards_----_---
                                               
                                               
most used wild card is the * wildcard is goes with everything litterlally everything or nearly everything 


Ex - so ls * it gives allllllllllllll the possible folder directories etc littrally everything in the main folder

the another most used wild card is the ? wild card that matches only one character long thing 


Ex - ls ?.txt it will only give the results which is one letter, number, expressitions etc if it has more than 1 character is gives a error



and a another aupiscously selective wildcard is the square brackets ( [] ) these a more selective because they only give the availaible optiont in the brackets



ex - ls [1234567890].txt and you have a file named 1.txt and it matches it and gives the result
